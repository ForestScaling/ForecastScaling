# Forest Scaling & Disturbance Forecasting

This repository contains R scripts for forecasting tree demographic responses to disturbance and climate. The workflow integrates remote sensing data, field survey measurements, and machine learning models.

#### Features

Random Forest forecasting: Predict changes in tree densities using caret and ranger, including quantile regression for probabilistic forecasts.

Overlap and validation: Compute overlap statistics between observed and simulated posterior distributions to assess model predictive performance.
